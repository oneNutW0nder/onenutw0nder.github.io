# About Me

Hello and welcome to my blog where I'll document anything fun and exciting that I do related to computers and security. I will be slowly adding a backlog of posts and writeups that I have been putting off for the better part of a year so stay tuned and check back frequently!

I graduated from [RIT](https://www.rit.edu/) in 2021 with my _BS_ and _MS_ in [Computing Security](https://www.rit.edu/computing/department-computing-security). During my time at school I was heavily involved in my school's security club [RITSEC](https://www.ritsec.club/). I also competed on our [CCDC](https://www.nationalccdc.org/) team where we placed 3rd and 5th at the National level in 2019 and 2020 respectively.

I enjoy playing in CTF's where I focus on _web_ and _pwn_ challenges. I enjoy learning about all parts of security and computers especially when it is from the red team perspective. 

Please reach out via my Github or Linkedin if you have any questions or just want to chat!
